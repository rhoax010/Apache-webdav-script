# WebDAV Setup Script
WebDAV (Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning) is an extension of the HTTP protocol that allows clients to perform remote authoring and management of files on web servers. It provides a set of methods that allow users to create, read, write, and modify files over the web, essentially turning a web server into a file system accessible over the internet.

This script automates the installation and configuration of a WebDAV server on Apache for Linux environments.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- A Linux-based server with Apache installed

## Usage
Run the script with root or sudo privileges:
```bash
python3 webdav_setup.py
